# ABSTRACT

## Background:
Although there is an increasing awareness that subfertility constitutes a serious public health issue, few studies
consider how the experience of different ethnicities of women accessing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
is formed by their particular social positions. Effective strategies that address structural and sociocultural barriers
to ART are required to mitigate its potential long-term physical, financial and psychological effects in order to
inform the design of more inclusive and supportive interventions.

## Methods
Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Pubmed as well as grey literature were systematically
searched for studies published from 1978 to 02 December 2020. Inclusion criteria with respect to eligibility and
quality were applied. Qualitative data was extracted on content and methods, then critically appraised for
methodological quality using the CASP toolkit. The findings of eleven qualitative studies were combined using
thematic synthesis and organised according to patients’ experience and assessment of service quality and
dimensions of patient-centredness. Additionally, data on the sociocultural barriers that may impact patients’
perspective on care was collected. The thematic synthesis consisted of three stages: coding of text 'line-by-line';
the development of 'descriptive themes' and the development of 'analytical themes'.

## Results
This review explores the perceptions of illness, subfertility and the ability to access ART of subfertile women
across West Africa (n = 4); South Africa (n = 3); Central Africa (n = 1) and Europe (n = 3). Six themes emerged
relating to each perceived quality of care and perceived barriers to accessing ART. The complex health seeking
behaviours of women revealed they sought biomedical and holistic treatment as well as help from Christian and
Islamic places of worship. Although treatment choice was related to the perceived aetiology of subfertility, it was
also influenced by perceived access to effective treatment. Those from a lower socioeconomic background who
faced barriers to treatment were also more likely to be confronted with the social stigma of subfertility as well as
intimate partner violence.

## Conclusion
The lives of subfertile women were characterised by social suffering incurred from gender and pro-natal norms,
cultural beliefs and practices as well as limited access to ART. An intersectional approach may be used to inform
public health strategies and social policy by highlighting how in particular scenarios, certain groups may
experience greater barriers accessing ART and thus are more vulnerable than others. Services may need to invest
in working with organisations, like the British Fertility Society, to promote a more patient-centred service offering
better integrated care and support to encourage wider engagement.
