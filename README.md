## Methods Summary
This systematic review explores barriers to accessing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) for subfertile women across Africa and Europe with a focus on sociocultural, economic and structural influences on patient experiences. The review investigates how ethnic and geographic differences shape these barriers and the mental health outcomes of women undergoing ART.

### Search Strategy
The aim of the literature search was to identify relevant studies that address the barriers and perceived quality of care in ART for subfertile women across Africa and Europe. The search strategy balanced recall (sensitivity) and precision (relevancy) to ensure comprehensive identification of relevant studies while minimising the inclusion of irrelevant articles.

#### Search Strategy Components:
##### 1. Search Methods:
* The search combined thesaurus, free-text and broad-based terms to maximize recall which is crucial for systematic reviews in healthcare. Empirical evidence indicates that relying on one strategy alone can lead to missing relevant studies. Thus, a combination of all three approaches was employed to ensure comprehensive retrieval (Shaw et al. 2004).
* The inclusion of Boolean operators such as “AND” “OR” and “NOT” ensured that the search was both wide-ranging and focused, with the "NOT" operator used to refine search results and prevent irrelevant studies from being included (Booth 2006).

##### 2. Keywords and Descriptors:
* Key terms included: “subfertility” “infertility” “ART” “assisted reproductive technology” “barriers” “patient experience” “ethnicity” “cultural differences” and “mental health” In particular, the search incorporated a variety of terms for ethnicity such as “African” “Caribbean” “Black” “ethnic minorities” and “immigrants” to capture the full scope of literature on ethnic differences in ART access.
* Geographic focus: To ensure a comprehensive search, countries in Africa and Europe were prioritized, with specific inclusion of high IVF volume countries like Ghana, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa as well as countries with significant African and Caribbean diaspora populations in Europe (e.g., France, Belgium, Germany, Spain and the UK).

##### 3. Database Selection:
*The review covered multiple electronic bibliographic databases like:
  * EMBASE, MEDLINE, ASSIA, ERIC, CINAHL, and PubMed, representing disciplines in medicine, nursing, and social sciences.
  * Peer-reviewed fertility journals such as the International Journal of Fertility and Human Fertility were also searched to capture domain-specific research.
* Additional manual searching through snowball sampling was conducted by reviewing the reference lists of eligible studies to identify other potentially relevant articles (Edwards et al. 2002; Pedro et al. 2018).

##### 4. Timeframe:
* The search covered studies published from 1978 (the introduction of IVF to the public) through to 31 March 2020. This timeframe was chosen to explore trends and changes over time particularly in patient autonomy, societal shifts and policy changes.

##### 5. Inclusion of Non-English Studies:
* Only English-language studies were included in the review, due to resource constraints in translation. However, the inclusion of a broad set of countries in both Africa and Europe helped ensure diversity in the sample.

##### 6. Study Design & Methods:
* Qualitative studies that used interviews, focus groups, grounded theory, phenomenology, ethnography and participant observation were prioritized.
* Exclusion of quantitative studies, including randomized controlled trials, surveys and longitudinal cohort studies, aligned with the review's focus on patient experience rather than efficacy of ART treatments.

##### 7. Ethnic and Cultural Scope:
* While the focus was on ethnic diversity, terms like “Black”, “African”, “Caribbean” and “immigrants” were specifically included to capture variations in access and experience based on ethnicity and cultural factors.
* Countries with high IVF unit registrations in Africa (e.g., South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Egypt) were prioritized to reflect the diverse fertility care landscape.

##### 8. Verification & Screening:
* A verification strategy was used, in which the Boolean NOT was employed to ensure that no relevant records were missed. This helped refine the search process and mitigate the potential for missing relevant literature (Booth 2006).
* The abstract screening process identified studies for inclusion or exclusion based on relevance, study design and geographical focus. Due to challenges in indexing qualitative studies, this step ensured that all relevant studies were thoroughly reviewed.

##### 9. Expert Consultation:
* Though resource-intensive, an expert consultation strategy was also employed where researchers and professionals with expertise in ART and related fields were approached. This method helped uncover potentially elusive or unpublished studies, adding rigor to the review process (Pearson et al. 2011; Edwards et al. 2002).

##### 10. Final Selection:
After combining the results from electronic searches, snowball sampling and expert recommendations, all studies were carefully reviewed using the PRISMA flow diagram to track the inclusion and exclusion process. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were categorized for data extraction while those that did not meet the criteria were excluded with reasons documented.

This search strategy is designed to maximise both recall (sensitivity) and precision (relevancy), ensuring that all relevant studies are identified while minimising the inclusion of irrelevant articles. The combination of thesaurus-based, free-text and broad-based searches, along with manual snowball sampling and expert consultation, ensures a comprehensive and inclusive search for studies related to ART access, barriers and the perceived quality of care across Africa and Europe.

### Eligibility Criteria
* Population: Women who are clinically subfertile (in accordance with WHO guidelines) and can access ART in Africa and Europe.
* Phenomenon of Interest: Perceived barriers to ART access and the perceived quality of care excluding studies focused solely on the efficacy of ART treatments.
* Inclusion Criteria:
  * Women from diverse ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
  * Studies exploring patient experiences from the time of ART diagnosis and treatment initiation (1978–2020).
  * Qualitative studies using methods like interviews, focus groups and ethnography.
  * Studies that provide a cross-ethnic or cross-geographic comparison of experiences.

### Exclusion Criteria:
* Studies without information on ethnicity.
* Quantitative studies (including randomised controlled trials) and reviews.
* Studies in non-English languages or without original data (e.g., conference abstracts).

### Data Management and Study Selection
A two-stage screening process was used, where duplicates were removed and studies were categorized as ‘INCLUDE’, ‘EXCLUDE’ or ‘MAYBE’.
Full-text articles underwent further review to determine eligibility and a PRISMA flow diagram was used to document the selection process.

### Data Extraction
Key study details (design, participants as well as context) and participant perspectives on ART access were extracted verbatim into a data extraction form.

### Critical Appraisal:
* Appraisal Tool: Studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) to ensure methodological rigour and relevance.

### Synthesis Process:
#### Three-Stage Thematic Synthesis Approach:
* Line-by-Line Coding: Initial extraction and coding of key concepts and insights from study texts.
* Descriptive Themes: Development of overarching descriptive themes based on coded data.
* Analytical Themes: In-depth synthesis of descriptive themes into higher-level analytical themes, focusing on barriers, patient experiences and contextual factors.

### Frameworks & Methodological Approach:
* Thematic Synthesis: A robust qualitative method used to integrate and synthesise findings across studies while respecting cultural and contextual differences.
* Health Systems Equity Lens: The project used a health systems framework to examine how systemic, sociocultural and economic factors intersect to affect ART access across Africa and Europe.

## Key Findings
* Six core themes identified relating to care quality and access barriers.  Treatment-seeking often blended biomedical, traditional and spiritual strategies
* Barriers varied by socioeconomic status, education, religion and geography
* Subfertile women especially in lower-income contexts were more vulnerable to stigma, intimate partner violence and social exclusion
* Access to ART was closely tied to ability to pay and perceptions of fertility causation (be it either spiritual, biological or social)

## Relevance to Health Systems
This review applies systems thinking by:

* Highlighting how intersectionality influences access and outcomes
* Linking patient-centred care with broader health equity goals
* Informing how reproductive services can be adapted to diverse populations
* Emphasising the importance of qualitative evidence in policy and service design

## Tools & Frameworks
### PICO Framework:
The review used the PICO framework to clarify the research focus:

* Population (P): Subfertile women of diverse ethnicities from Africa and Europe.
* Intervention (I): Access to Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).
* Comparison (C): Variations in ART access across ethnic groups and geographic regions (Africa vs. Europe).
* Outcome (O): Barriers to ART access, including sociocultural, economic and structural challenges.

### Thematic Synthesis:
A qualitative approach used to synthesize the findings from the included studies. The process involved three stages:
* Line-by-line coding: Identifying and categorizing relevant data from study abstracts, results and discussions.
* Descriptive themes: Grouping similar codes to form thematic categories.
* Analytical themes: Interpreting the data to identify overarching patterns and insights.

### CASP Quality Appraisal:
The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist was used to assess the methodological quality and rigor of included qualitative studies. This tool ensures that the studies meet high standards and provide credible, dependable insights into patient experiences.

### Patient-Centred Care Framework:
This framework emphasizes understanding the experiences, values and preferences of patients. It was essential for framing the review through the lens of patient-centered care, prioritising patient perspectives and ensuring that ART services align with their needs.

### Health Systems Equity Lens:
A tool used to explore how systemic factors (social, economic and cultural) affect healthcare access and outcomes. This lens allowed the review to highlight inequities in ART access particularly for marginalised groups as well as inform strategies for improving reproductive healthcare equity gloabally.
