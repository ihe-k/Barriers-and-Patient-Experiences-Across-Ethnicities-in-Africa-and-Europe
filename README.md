# Barriers-and-Patient-Experiences-Across-Ethnicities-in-Africa-and-Europe
This repository presents a systematic review and thematic synthesis exploring the barriers faced by subfertile women of different ethnicities when accessing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) across Africa and Europe. The project applies a health systems lens to examine sociocultural, economic and structural factors shaping patient experiences.

## Focus: Equity in reproductive health access‚Ä®üß≠ Methods: Systematic review, CASP appraisal, thematic synthesis‚Ä®üåç Themes: Health-seeking behaviour, stigma, gender norms, socioeconomic disparities

## Objectives
* To identify barriers to accessing ART for women across different ethnic and geographic contexts
* To synthesise patient-reported experiences of care through a patient-centred lens
* To highlight systemic inequities in reproductive healthcare access
* To inform policy as well as health system strategies through an intersectional and qualitative analysis

## Methods Summary
This systematic review explores barriers to accessing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) for subfertile women across Africa and Europe, with a focus on sociocultural, economic, and structural influences on patient experiences. The review investigates how ethnic and geographic differences shape these barriers and the mental health outcomes of women undergoing ART.

### Eligibility Criteria
* Population: Women who are clinically subfertile (in accordance with WHO guidelines) and can access ART in Africa and Europe.
* Phenomenon of Interest: Perceived barriers to ART access and the perceived quality of care, excluding studies focused solely on the efficacy of ART treatments.
* Inclusion Criteria:
** Women from diverse ethnic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds.
** Studies exploring patient experiences from the time of ART diagnosis and treatment initiation (1978‚Äì2020).
** Qualitative studies using methods like interviews, focus groups, and ethnography.
** Studies that provide a cross-ethnic or cross-geographic comparison of experiences.

### Exclusion Criteria:
* Studies without information on ethnicity.
* Quantitative studies (including randomized controlled trials) and reviews.
* Studies in non-English languages or without original data (e.g., conference abstracts).

### Data Management and Study Selection
A two-stage screening process was used, where duplicates were removed, and studies were categorized as ‚ÄòINCLUDE‚Äô, ‚ÄòEXCLUDE‚Äô, or ‚ÄòMAYBE‚Äô.
Full-text articles underwent further review to determine eligibility, and a PRISMA flow diagram was used to document the selection process.

### Data Extraction
Key study details (design, participants, context) and participant perspectives on ART access were extracted verbatim into a data extraction form.

### Critical Appraisal:
** Appraisal Tool: Studies were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) to ensure methodological rigour and relevance.

### Synthesis Process:
#### Three-Stage Thematic Synthesis Approach:
* Line-by-Line Coding: Initial extraction and coding of key concepts and insights from study texts.
* Descriptive Themes: Development of overarching descriptive themes based on coded data.
* Analytical Themes: In-depth synthesis of descriptive themes into higher-level analytical themes, focusing on barriers, patient experiences, and contextual factors.
### Frameworks & Methodological Approach:
* Thematic Synthesis: A robust qualitative method used to integrate and synthesise findings across studies while respecting cultural and contextual differences.
* Health Systems Equity Lens: The project used a health systems framework to examine how systemic, sociocultural and economic factors intersect to affect ART access across Africa and Europe.

## Key Findings
* Six core themes identified relating to care quality and access barriers.  Treatment-seeking often blended biomedical, traditional and spiritual strategies
* Barriers varied by socioeconomic status, education, religion and geography
* Subfertile women especially in lower-income contexts were more vulnerable to stigma, intimate partner violence and social exclusion
* Access to ART was closely tied to ability to pay and perceptions of fertility causation (be it either spiritual, biological or social)

## Relevance to Health Systems
This review applies systems thinking by:
Highlighting how intersectionality influences access and outcomes
Linking patient-centred care with broader health equity goals
Informing how reproductive services can be adapted to diverse populations
Emphasising the importance of qualitative evidence in policy and service design

## Tools & Frameworks
### PICO Framework:
The review used the PICO framework to clarify the research focus:

* Population (P): Subfertile women of diverse ethnicities from Africa and Europe.
* Intervention (I): Access to Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).
* Comparison (C): Variations in ART access across ethnic groups and geographic regions (Africa vs. Europe).
* Outcome (O): Barriers to ART access, including sociocultural, economic and structural challenges.

### Thematic Synthesis:
A qualitative approach used to synthesize the findings from the included studies. The process involved three stages:
* Line-by-line coding: Identifying and categorizing relevant data from study abstracts, results and discussions.
* Descriptive themes: Grouping similar codes to form thematic categories.
* Analytical themes: Interpreting the data to identify overarching patterns and insights.

### CASP Quality Appraisal:
The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist was used to assess the methodological quality and rigor of included qualitative studies. This tool ensures that the studies meet high standards and provide credible, dependable insights into patient experiences.

### Patient-Centred Care Framework:
This framework emphasizes understanding the experiences, values and preferences of patients. It was essential for framing the review through the lens of patient-centered care, prioritising patient perspectives and ensuring that ART services align with their needs.

### Health Systems Equity Lens:
A tool used to explore how systemic factors (social, economic and cultural) affect healthcare access and outcomes. This lens allowed the review to highlight inequities in ART access particularly for marginalised groups as well as inform strategies for improving reproductive healthcare equity gloabally.
