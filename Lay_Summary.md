# LAY SUMMARY

In this review, subfertility is understood to be a condition where women are unable to bear or have children
following previous pregnancies. Not much is known about which women report fears of subfertility or how it
affects the actions they take to get better, such as provider type sought. To learn more about it, studies were
searched to explore the experiences of women who use European and African healthcare systems whilst they cope
with being unable to have children (subfertile) and deal with potential stigma, physical and emotional abuse from
their family and community.

Being subfertile affected how subfertile women were treated by their partners, relatives and friends in different
ways depending on their wealth, education and religion. Results showed the risk of developing long-term mental
health and financial issues whilst accessing fertility treatment (ART) may vary according to where you live in the
country. As being able to use ART was dependent on their ability to find, be seen by a helpful doctor and pay, ART
was limited mostly to women able to afford it without help from the government. Fear also influenced how they
sought treatment. For example, the fear that their subfertility was Godâ€™s punishment for past misbehaviour and the
lack of affordable, high quality ART services nearby led some women to seek traditional healing and spiritual
mediation despite the risk of financial exploitation or harm. Poorer women were found more likely to face abuse
from their partner, family-in-law and community. Muslim women feared that their husband would divorce them or
marry an additional wife. As a result, women, particularly those of African origin were vulnerable to emotional
and physical abuse and suffered greater financial consequences.

This review helps to ensure better understanding among those providing services about how to target, prioritise and allocate money to better meet the needs of subfertile women across Africa and Europe.
